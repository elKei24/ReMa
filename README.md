# ReMa
Simulation of a simple register machine, combined with a code editor with syntax highlighting for the machine code.

I wrote this as a replacement for the register machine simulation application we used at school (it was really, really bad).
Due to that, the machine language used in this application is more or less the same as the one used in our school books, 
apart from some commands I added additionally.

This is an old hobby project from 2016. Not everything is working fine, and I would use an other coding style and better software 
designs in big parts of the project now, but however I wanted to back up this stuff on GitHub.
